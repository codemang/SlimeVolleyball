Slime Volleyball
===============

This is a port of the popular [Slime Volleyball Game](http://oneslime.net/) to Javascript. Along the way, we're trying to add a bunch of awesome new features, like online multi-player and AI bot competitions.

## Getting Started

Running `setup.sh` will run some basic npm commands to get your development environment up to speed.

`link.md` contains some helpful links in getting up to speed with node, express, socket-io, networked game development, etc.

Run `npm start` to run the server locally.

To build in production do

```
npm run build
npm run serve
```
